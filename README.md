## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned about css custom propertiesa and css modifier classes.
I learnt about flexbox and grid and how it is used to make layouts.

```html
<div class="wrapper wrapper--narrow">
```
```css
:root{
  --ff-sans: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  
}
html{
  font-family: var(--ff-sans);
}
/*this property selects the immediate child and make the elements grow by constant dimension*/
.layout-grid > *{
    flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I am a begineer and i am still currently learning css. I did this project to learn how layouts are to be designed. I still struggle with grid layouts and media queries. I will be continuing learning more about grid and media queries.

### Useful resources

I am following kevin powell's explanation and walkthrough. I was getting stuck in between the video so i was also following mdn docs side by side.
- [(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFbxl_VmIx0)] - I followed this video as a guide on how to make layouts. I just learnt about HTML and CSS so making layouts on the spot is challenging for me. This helped me on brain storminig and planning stuff
- [(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)] - This is an amazing resource for learning html and css and whenever i was getting stuck i went here to learn and clear my doubts.
